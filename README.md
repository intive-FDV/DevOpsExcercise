# DevOps Excercise #

Implement a CSharp webapp that shows the current date and time
Provide detailed instructions to make the application run on a Windows Server 2012 R2 machine

## Considerations ##
* To build the app you should use .net 4.5.2
* Assume the Windows server has a default installation (no IIS, no .Net4.5, etc, etc)
* The procedure associated to point 2 can contain manual steps, but the more automated, the better
* You can use the whatever tool to want with the restrictions that those tools should be accessible by us in a free way

## Deliverables ##
A link to a github repository that should include the application code and a README.md file with detailed instructions to build and install the application.


## Requirements ##
The solution to the exercise should show us that you are able to:
* Automate the packaging part of the process 
* use CI concepts in order to provision needed software in order for the deliverables to run
* use CI concepts to promote deliverable through environments
* use any CI tool of your choice to deploy the deliverable
